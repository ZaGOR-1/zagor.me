    "title": "About Me",
    "subtitle": "Get to know me better",
    "description": "I'm a 2nd year student majoring in 121 — Software Engineering at Zhytomyr Polytechnic. My passion for programming started back in school, and since then I have been constantly expanding my knowledge and skills.",
    "paragraph1": "I am fascinated by the process of creating software from idea to implementation. I actively study modern web development technologies, algorithms and data structures, as well as principles of software system design.",
    "paragraph2": "I constantly work on my own projects to apply theoretical knowledge in practice. My career goal is to become a professional software developer and create products that improve people's lives.",
    "paragraph3": "Beyond programming, I'm passionate about chess, which helps me develop strategic thinking and the ability to anticipate consequences of my decisions. I also love reading science fiction — especially Isaac Asimov's works, which inspire me to think about the future of technology. In my free time, I play guitar, which helps me find balance between the logic of programming and creativity.",
    "philosophy": "I believe that the best way to learn programming is to write code every day. Even small steps lead to great achievements if you move consistently and persistently.",
    "funFact": "Fun fact: my first piece of code was a 'Guess the Number' game in Python that I created at 15 years old. It worked on the first try, and that magical moment convinced me to become a developer!",
